                </li>
                <p>John Fitzgerald, a seasoned martial artist with a wealth of experience spanning nearly two decades, began his journey in combat sports following a stint in the Irish Naval service. Under the tutelage of esteemed mentors such as Sensei John McGrath and Grandmaster Massan Ghorbani, John immersed himself in various disciplines including Kickboxing, Hapkido, Jiu Jitsu, and Satori Do Karate. His dedication and perseverance led to the attainment of his 4th Dan in Kickboxing and 1st Dan in Kombatan.

In 2008, John achieved his first Kickboxing Dan belt, followed by his Kombatan Black belt in 2010. His passion for martial arts took him to Boston, where he played a pivotal role in establishing a dojo under the guidance of John McGrath, further honing his skills alongside esteemed martial arts masters such as Andre Dodeco and Rob Massan.

2010, John founded his own Martial Arts school, Celtic Dragon Martial Arts and Fitness, in New Ross, offering a comprehensive curriculum encompassing K1, kickboxing, weapon and open hand forms, Kombatan, fighters class, as well as cardio and strength and conditioning classes. Under his leadership, the school produced two world champions and earned multiple accolades on national and international stages.

Despite challenges, including rising costs, John remained committed to his passion, transitioning the school to Anonymous Kickboxing and later to KBX Kickboxing in partnership with Master Marvin Ponde, following the passing of Wayne Smith. Now, with Celtic Dragon KBX Kickboxing, John continue his coaching journey, dedicated to imparting knowledge, fostering personal growth, and contributing to the community through their shared passion for martial arts.

                    <p>2nd Dan Sensei Jamie Smith</p>
                </li>
                <p>Jamie began his kickboxing journey at the age of four under the guidance of Pat Rockets, quickly discovering his talent and passion for the sport. By the age of seven, he joined KBX, a club run by his late father, Wayne. It was there that Jamie's skills flourished, culminating in him earning his black belt at just eleven years old. His time at KBX instilled in him a strong sense of discipline, leading to numerous victories and a notable second-place finish at the WOMA World Championship in Dublin.

From the age of eight, Jamie has been imparting his kickboxing knowledge to eager students, continuing to teach to this day. His family has a rich history in kickboxing; his sister Courtney is an Irish Champion and holds a second-dan black belt. Jamie has also trained with Sensei John since he was eight years old. Together, they are dedicated to preserving and advancing his father's legacy through their work with Celtic Dragon KBX
